        "Briefly describe what you think the industry as a whole and/or employers could do to improve mental health support for employees.": "For software engineers having a depression or a mental illness is almost the equivalent of disability. If your brain is not working properly, how can yo work?\n\nWe need to look at the issue in both sides, one as an employee and another as an employer. As a company, you need to meet deliverables so you can earn and pay your employees. As an employee, you need that time so you can heal and perform better and help the company to grow. Taking into consideration this perspective, you can't really blame neither the company or the employee.\n\nSo how do we fix this? (and this answer will be based on my experiences)\n\n1 - Physical health is important. If your body is not well, your mind will not be as well. A healthy diet and sports should be a part of every company incentives for a healthy life.\n\n2 - Burnout: A stressed software engineer will surely burn out quickly. Stress sources can come from many places, but most of them come from work demand with unreasonable deadlines. If a developer is working more than 40 hours a week on a constant basis, burning out is just a matter of time. Knowing that burnout/stress is an issue, the employee and the company MUST address it properly.\n\n3 - Culture: This one speaks to me personally. One of the issues that I had the most were environments where there is a poisonous culture generated by the development team. Improper leadership and cliques just add to a bad culture and that will lead to stress. Unfortunately, there is no easy fix for this. If the culture of the company is bad you are better of leaving.\n\n4 - Clear expectations: Once an issue has been identified and treatment is in progress it is important that both the company and the employee have clear expectations. The stress that is generated by an expectation that was not laid out on the start will surely add up to the illness.",

I was a PhD student and disclosed to my supervisors that I was suffering from depression and anxiety but was seeing a therapist and taking steps to feel better. (This was partly related to the poor progress of my project, and their supervision style.) They said they understood but treated me with a very kid-gloves approach for a few weeks, then demanded to ask mu therapist questions about me. Eventually I agreed to let them send their questions to an HR person, who would act as an intermediary between them and the therapist. They wanted to know if I was a danger to myself or others. The therapist replied that I was not. My supervisors then told me that the therapist\u2019s answer showed that my illness was no excuse for the poor state of my project. They put me on a ten-week \u2018improvement plan\u2019 that was logically impossible to succeed at, and then pushed me out of the PhD studentship.",

One size fits all offerings of gym membership and health insurance is nothing more than a HR box ticking exercise. Providing access to counseling services would probably be more beneficial. In 26 years of being in the industry I have never once availed of the services of a gym. I used to cycle to work every day and it was great physical exercise and also a chance to clear my mind. In the past year I have attended a counselor and have found it very beneficial, my only regret is that I didn't have the opportunity or wasn't aware of it's benefits 20+ years ago. Helping people identify and deal with issues they are experiencing would be of huge benefit to an organisation.

During a period when I wasn't doing well, my manager didn't feel like they could ask about how I was doing, or about what kind of support would be helpful. They were relieved when I (without a direct ask from them) let them know that I was not actively suicidal. They talked through some options with me, and expressed that it would be okay for me to take a leave-of-absence for a mental illness (with proper documentation). \n\nI navigated setting up intermittent FMLA leave on my own, with the LOA company that our company outsources all LOA-related info to. Several months into this, my manager and my future manager let me know that HR is hustling to make an intermittent-LOA policy because no one else in the company of 10,000+ people has ever taken FMLA leave on an intermittent basis. I let them know that $outsource_company has been tracking my leave, and that they had no problems setting it up under the existing FMLA policies. \n\nI'm seriously considering negotiating down to part time work because I don't want to spend my energy navigating the medical/legal parts of the healthcare/leave system.

One of the coworkers I play board games with during lunch on Fridays has expressed concern when I'm not in the office for board games or for the weekly catered lunch. \n\nThey've been supportive, but also had the deer-in-headlights \"I have no clue what to say here\" look that makes me hesitant to share in the future. \n\nI'm not comfortable sharing information about my mental health with the folks I work with on a daily basis.",
