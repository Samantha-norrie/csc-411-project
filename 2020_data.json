        "Briefly describe what you think the industry as a whole and/or employers could do to improve mental health support for employees.": "Change work culture. Billable hours and timesheets are a false and pointless dataset. Work life balance is a sham. Flexibility is a double edged sword. 8 hour work days are arbitrary inventions with a history steeped in human rights movements to prevent capitalist abuse, not grounded in science or a sense of productivity or purpose. Time management and productivity hacking is all a traffic driving click bait farce. We should be adopting target driven business and staff management/ reporting approaches (which hopefully I'll get to build for one day if I don't kill myself first...). We are humans. We are messy and broken and that's supposed to be what makes life glorious, but instead of just quietly pursuing \"enough\", we're chained to our desks in an effort to protect our families well being in a sycophantic attempt to grab the proverbial dangled carrot from whoever sits above us in the food chain, who yells down  \"ENOUGH is just a little bit more\". Personally, I'd rather be dead, but I've got mouths to feed...",
